      "There isn’t a brand like this in Nigeria presently that I know of. I know a couple of European prop firm but Ft9ja’s service is innovative, flexible, and more suitable for Naija Traders. Trust me, they are going blow soon. The only issue is their customer service; they don’t respond on time on weekends. Enjoying trading for them currently, prompt payments…would recommend them anytime and any day",
